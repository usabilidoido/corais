1.  Introduction

The Domain Access: Domain Alias module, is an optional extension of the
Domain Access module.  Domain Alias provides advanced options
for configuring domain request handling by your site.

----
1.1 Use-Case

Some sites have very specific rules for displaying their urls to users.
For example, yahoo.com redirects all site visitors to www.yahoo.com,
whereas drupal.org redirects all requests to www.drupal.org to the
canonical url drupal.org.

Supporting these conflicting rules led to the creation of Domain Alias,
a system for managing domain handling for multiple domains that
should be treated as a single domain by the Domain Access module.

This module is useful for cases where wildcard DNS is supported, or
when you cannot modify your DNS hosts file.

----
1.2 Example

Let us assume that our main site is example.com and we run two
sub sites at users.example.com and testing.example.com.

Out sample site allows wildcard DNS, so any request to
*.example.com will be passed to our Drupal site.  We would like the
following rules to be obeyed:

-- www.example.com should redirect to example.com.
-- exmpl.com, which we also own, should be treated as a request to
    example.com.
-- *.users.example.com should inherit the settings for users.example.com.
-- *.testing.example.com should be treated as invalid and directed to
    example.com.

Under this complex scenario, we would configure the following domains:

-- Primary domains == example.com
-- Domain 1 == users.example.com
-- Domain 2 == testing.example.com

Under Domain Alias, we would then enable the following settings for each domain.

== example.com ==
exmple.com [no redirect]
www.example.com [redirect]
*.testing.example.com [redirect]

== users.example.com ==
*.users.example.com [no redirect]

== testing.example.com ==
No aliases needed.

See section 3 for more information about configuring aliases.

2.  Installation

The Domain Alias module is included in the Domain Access download.  To install,
untar the domain package and place the entire folder in your modules directory.

When you enable the module, it will create a {domain_alias} table in your Drupal
database.

----
2.1   Dependencies

Domain Alias requires the Domain Access module be installed and active.

----
3.  Alias Management

The Domain Alias module adds a new column to the Domain List table.  If you
go to the Domain List at Admin > Build > Domains > Domain List.  You should
now see an "Aliases" column in your domain list.

----
3.1  Creating Aliases

To create a new alias, go to the Domain List at Admin > Build > Domains > Domain
List.  You should see an "Aliases" column in your domain list.

Click on the 'add alias' link.  You will be presented with a form devided into
two parts.  The top section, 'Registered aliases for *' will be empty initially.

Under 'Add new aliases,' you may add up to five (5) aliases at a time. (If you
need to add more, enter the first five and save the form.)

Check the 'redirect' box only if you wish to redirect requests made to the alias
to go to the regsitered domain for that alias.

Enter the pattern(s) that you wish to match and click 'Save aliases.'

----
3.2   Updating Aliases

Once you have created a set of aliases, the 'Aliases' column on the Domain List
will show the current aliases, with a link to 'edit aliases.'

Clicking on this link will show the Edit domain aliases page; this time, the top
section of the form will show your current registered aliases.

To modify an alias, simply change the pattern text or toggle the redirect
option.

To delete an alias, check the 'Delete' box on the right side of the form.

Click 'Save aliases' to make your changes.

----
3.3   Pattern Matching Options

The patterns that you may enter can be simple strings, like one.example.com.

You may also use wildcard characters for advanced pattern matching.

You may specify a pattern for your domains by using * (asterisk) to match any
number of random characters and ? (question mark) to match exactly one random
character.

For example: *.example.com would match any HTTP request made to a subdomain of
example.com to the domain record for example.com.

Using wildcards is a good way to reduce the number of aliases that you need to
maintain.

NOTE: Only one wildcard is allowed per alias.

----
3.4   Redirecting Aliases

For each alias that you create, you have the option of forcing a redirect when
users make a request to that domain.  If enabled, redirects will send the user
to the registered domain.

This setting is unique to each alias.

For example, you may want to handle requests to example.com as follows:

-- Leave www.example.com alone.
-- Direct all other requests to example.com.

In this case, example.com is the 'registered domain,' and you would create the
following aliases:

-- www.example.com [no redirect]
-- *.example.com [redirect]

This feature can be used in conjunction with the Domain Access setting for WWW
Prefix Handling (see 4.3.5 WWW Prefix Handling in the main README.txt). However,
you must take care not to set up an infinite redirect loop when configuring your
aliases.

----
4.  Domain Alias Switcher Block

Instead of using the Domain Switcher block provided by Domain Access, Domain
Alias provides a substitute block for debugging.

The block presents a nested list of domains and aliases, highlighting both the
currently active domain (in boldface) and the active alias (in italics), if
applicable.

Note that the block uses string substitution and may write links that fail to
resolve on your site -- this is intentional and is a DNS issue, not a bug. In
some cases, the module will write the entry as plain text to avoid such 'dead'
links. For example:

Your site has the following domains and aliases:

-- example.com
  -- www.example.com
-- one.example.com
  -- *.example.com
-- foo.one.example.com
  -- foo.*.example.com

If you send a request to 'bar.example.com' the domain switcher will write
the following links:

-- example.com
  -- www.example.com
-- one.example.com
  -- bar.example.com
-- foo.one.example.com
  -- foo.bar.example.com

If your server is not configured to handle all of the above DNS requests, you
may get a server error when you click on a link.

NOTE: that this only works with the * wildcard, and assumes that the * reprsents
an entire node of the host string.

WARNING: The Domain Alias Switcher block should not be used as a navigation tool
for normal site visitors. It is provided to site developers to aid in debugging.

5.  Developer Notes

----
5.1  Database Schema

Installing the module creates a {domain_conf} table that contains:

  - alias_id
  Integer, unique
  The lookup key for the record.

  - domain_id
  Integer
  The matching key for this record, foreign key to the {domain} table.

  - pattern
  Varchar (255)
  The alias pattern to match against inbound requests.

  - redirect
  Integer (tiny)
  A boolean flag indicating that requests made to this alias should be
  redirected to the assigned domain_id.
