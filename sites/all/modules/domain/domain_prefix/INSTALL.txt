1.  Introduction

Table prefixing is an advanced Drupal option; it should only be performed by
experienced admins or by those willing to learn how table prefixing functions.

This module enhances the default $db_prefix routine documented inside
settings.php. It provides dynamic table loading per domain.

Domain Prefix should support both single (string) $db_prefix values and
complex (array) values.

2.  Installation

As of 6.x.2, this module is now loaded directly from settings.php when you install the
Domain module correctly.
