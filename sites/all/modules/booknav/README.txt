Booknav 1.0
===========
A module for showing full book navigation. 

Booknav aims to solve the following problems:

1. Two previous/next links blocks. Theses can i.e. be place above and below the blocks described below.
   This block can be configured to include all books on a site. It can also be configured to only be
   shown when reading a book. 

2. Create a expandable/collapsable treeview menu block for books.

3. Create a block for each book that implements problem 2.

4. Optionally, use top node title as title for block. In that case, the top node is removed from the book
   menu structure.

Booknav uses the jQuery plugin Treeview by JÃ¶rn Zaefferer:

  "Lightweight and flexible transformation of an unordered list into an expandable 
   and collapsable tree, great for unobtrusive navigation enhancements. Supports 
   both location and cookie based persistence."
