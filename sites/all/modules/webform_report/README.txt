Description:
------------
This module allows users to create simple, dynamic reports based on data
collected by the webform module. It adds a new node type that contains the
report criteria, and the data displayed is updated automatically as webforms
are submitted. The data can be sorted according to the viewer's preference
without altering the report criteria.

This module is written by Kristian Lance and sponsored by the Communications
Research Centre Canada (CRC), an agency of Industry Canada.

Dependencies
------------
This module requires the webform module, and will use the accents module to
correctly sort columns of accented characters, if installed and enabled.

Translation
-----------
French translation will soon be available.
