Requirements
------------
Drupal 6.x

Installation
------------
1. Copy the entire webform_report directory to the Drupal modules directory.

2. Login as an administrator. Enable the module in "administer" -> "modules"

Upgrading from any previous version
-----------------------------------
1. Copy the entire webform_report directory to the Drupal modules directory.

2. Login as the FIRST user or change the $access_check in update.php to FALSE

3. Run update.php (at http://www.yourdrupalsite/update.php)

The .POT file
-------------
The .POT file is a template file for translating the module into non-english languages.
If you are not interested in helping with translation you can safely remove this file 
(and the po directory).

Troubleshooting
---------------

Try disabling the module, then backing up and your database and removing
the webform_report table, then re-enabling the module and running update.php
as explained above. If that doesn't work, file a bug-report or support-request
at http://drupal.org/project/issues/webform_report, NOT the Drupal forum.
Module maintainers check the webform issues board much more frequently
than the generic Drupal forum.
