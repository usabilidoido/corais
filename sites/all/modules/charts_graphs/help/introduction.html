    <p>Charts and Graphs is a API for developers. It can easily be extended by
third-party modules that want to add their own charting implementations. It does
nothing by itself. It should only be installed if some other module requires it.</p>
    <p>See <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_charts">Views Charts</a> for
      the usage and user-centric application as the Charts and Graphs module is
      a framework + collection of implementation modules (under the api folder).
      Please read the README/INSTALL files of the implementations and the
      specific help pages since their installation may involve downloading flash
      components or third-party libraries. Drupal guidelines does not always
      allow packaging those with Drupal code.</p>
    <p>For a full description of the module, visit the
      <a href="http://drupal.org/project/charts_graphs">Charts and Graphs</a>
      module page.</p>
