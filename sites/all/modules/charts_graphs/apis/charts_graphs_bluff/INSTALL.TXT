Since version 3.6.1 Bluff is dual licensed - MIT and GPL - so it can be
distributed together with Charts and Graphs code.

Unfortunately, to implement IE support Bluff needs excanvas.js from Google and
excanvas.js is licensed under the Apache License so excanvas.js can't be 
distributed with Charts and Graphs code.

If you want IE support, please grab the excanvas_r3.zip file available at
http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/downloads/list.

From this zipped file take excanvas.js or excanvas.compiled.js and place it at
the DV_MODULE_PATH/apis/charts_graphs_bluff/bluff directory. Please remember to
rename excanvas.compiled.js file to excanvas.js if you choose to use 
excanvas.compiled.js.
