<p>
	You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or distributing the Software. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by CKSource, your use, installation, copying, or distribution of the Software indicates your acceptance of this License.</p>
<h2>
	3. Scope of License</h2>
<p>
	All rights of any kind to the Software which are not expressly granted in this Agreement are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by CKSource. The Software is protected by applicable national and international laws and treaties.</p>
<p>
	You may use, install, copy, and distribute the Software solely as expressly provided in this Agreement. You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Software, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so.</p>
<p>
	It is agreed that in exchange for the license set forth herein, you will pay a onetime license fee (&ldquo;License Fee&rdquo;). The fee value will be specified by CKSource at the moment of the purchase.</p>
<h2>
	4. License Model</h2>
<p>
	The Software may be installed exclusively on Drupal Websites in respect of one and only one of the following models (&ldquo;License Models&rdquo;) of Your choice:</p>
<p>
	a) (&ldquo;Website&rdquo;) Installing the Software on a single Drupal &nbsp;Website (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;). The Site URL (&ldquo;URL&rdquo;) must be specified at the moment of the purchase.

<p>
	c) (&ldquo;Developer&rdquo;) License valid for a single Developer Person to be able to perform Development Activities.</p>
<p>

<p>
	License Fees values may differ depending on the license model.</p>
<h2>
	5. Unlicensed Copies</h2>
<p>
	If you did not pay for a license, you may use unlicensed copies of the Software for the exclusive purpose of demonstration. In this case you will be using the Software in the &quot;demo mode&quot;. Without derogating from the forgoing, you may not use the Software in the &quot;demo mode&quot; for commercial purposes. The Software shall only be used for evaluation purposes and may not be used or disclosed for any other purposes, including without limitation, for external distribution, or for software development. You may not remove demo notices from the interface nor disable the ability to display such notices or otherwise modify the Software. Product support, if any, is not offered for the Software in the &quot;demo mode&quot;.</p>
<p>
	The Software may be automatically blocked and totally stop working after a certain period of time running in the &ldquo;demo mode&rdquo;. It is not allowed to extend the demo mode in such case and a valid license must be purchased to unblock the Software.</p>
<h2>
	6. Agreement Acceptance</h2>
<p>
	This Agreement is automatically accepted by both parties as long as You are in possession of a legal evidence (&ldquo;Legal Evidence&rdquo;) that the acceptance has taken place. The Legal Evidence can be represented by (i) an agreement signed by You and CKSource stating the acceptance of this Agreement or (ii) a valid purchase invoice, or fully paid order confirmation, provided by CKSource and addressed to You. The Legal Evidence must precisely indicate this Agreement Name, the Software Name, and the License Model chosen.</p>
<p>
	Legal Evidences may define further rights and limitation terms that are not described in this Agreement. Any term present in the Agreement that goes in conflict with the Legal Evidence terms is to be deleted or amended.</p>
<p>
	Legal Evidences for the Website License Model are not transferable to different Websites.</p>
<h2>
	7. Limitation on Releases</h2>
<p>
	This agreement is valid for all Releases of the Software that have the Release Date happening before the day calculated by adding 365 days to the date the Legal Evidence has been made effective. CKSource has no obligation to provide you any Release that is not released for general distribution to other CKSource&#39;s licensees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate CKSource to provide additional Releases to You under any circumstances.</p>
<h2>
	8. Support</h2>
<p>
	CKSource shall provide support for Developer Persons covered by valid Developer licenses for the period of 365 days following the day the Legal Evidence has been made effective.

CKSource is not in any way obliged to perform bug fixing or custom development activities as a result of a Support Request.</p>
<h2>
	9. License Key</h2>
<p>
	Following a valid License purchase, a unique license key (the &quot;License Key&quot;) may be provided to you, which allows for the activation of the Software. The License Key is subject to the restrictions set forth in this License and may not be disclosed or distributed in any way. The disclosure or distribution of the License Key shall constitute a breach of this License, the effect of which shall be the automatic termination and revocation of any and all the rights granted herein.</p>
<p>
	A single License Key may be issued for Licenses under the Developer License Model, which shall be installed on Development Servers only and will be valid for the number of Developers specified during the license purchase. Further License Keys for the Developer License Model may be issued to you, which will enlarge the allowed number of Developers using the Software on Development Servers that already have the Software installed and activated with any of the Developer Licenses You have purchased before.</p>
