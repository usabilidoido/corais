The Comment Registration module enables the inline registration of new accounts
while commenting. It works with or without the core anonymous commenting contact
information option as well as supports core behavior for account and/or email
verification.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
The module will do *NOTHING* if "Only site administrators can create new user accounts."
is the selected user registration option at admin/user/settings. Users must be able to 
register in order for them to be able to register inline.
 
  
INSTALLATION
------------
  
Install the the module like any other drupal module. 
See http://drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/modules for more information.
  
  
USAGE
-----
  
There is nothing to configure. Once the module is enabled, a checkbox, as well as 
the necessary fields (which fields show up will depend on the anonymous commenting
contact information option), will appear on the comment form that enables users to 
register inline during comment creation.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Before creating an issue in the module's issue queue, please verify that you've enabled
user registrations at admin/user/settings.
