Automatically convert certain classed links to modal popups and provides an API
to add custom modals quickly and easily.

With this tool, you can cause links to automatically open in modal dialogs. The
module's code simply examines all links in a document and turns any link with
the designated CSS selectors (by default, the class automodal), and turns those
links into modal links.

Additionally, you can add modals with your own settings to pages using the
automodal_add() function. For more details see the API.txt file.
