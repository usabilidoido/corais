OA Feeds [Optional]
-------------------

This module is a small enhancement of the OA Feeds module. It adds a checkbox to every group node. If this checkbox is 
deliberated checked "on", that group's content will be included in the Recent activity RSS feed. If it is left unchecked, the 
group content will be ignored by the RSS feed. This is intended to allow sites with sensitive information to have the necessary 
controls to not allow any content to be exposed to public RSS readers.
