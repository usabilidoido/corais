"Forword","<p>Years ago a country boy heard or read that if a simple
box having a hole of a certain size were set upon a post in
March or early April it would not be long before bluebirds
would be around to see if the place would do as a summer cottage.
So he took an old paint keg such as white lead is sold
in, nailed a cover across the top, cut an opening in the side and
then placed it on a post ten or twelve feet high. Only a day
or two passed before a soft call-note was heard, a flash of blue,
and the songster had arrived. His mate came a few days later
and the paint keg with its tenants became the center of interest
in my life. A second brood was reared in midsummer and when
the cool days of September came a fine flock left for the South.
Each year the house was occupied until the post decayed and
the paint keg fell down, but in memory the sad call-note is still
heard when spring comes, for it is house hunting time once more,
and the bluebirds are looking for the home they had known.</p>

<p>That boys elsewhere may know the joy of the companionship
of birds, this little book is written. Birds will come and
live near the houses of men whenever food and water are to be
had, safety from enemies is given, and when homes are built for
them to replace the shelters nature offered before men came with
their cultivated fields and crowded cities. The following pages
give pictures and drawings of houses that boys have built and
in which birds have lived. These houses are planned for the
species of birds that have become accustomed to civilization so
that they will inhabit the houses put up for them.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to Professor Chas. A. Bennett of
Bradley Institute and Mr. L. L. Simpson of The Manual Arts
Press for helpful suggestions and encouragement; to John Friese
for making the drawings; and to the following for the use of
the originals of the illustrations which tell most of the story.</p>

"Birds that live in nesting boxes","<p>Certain varieties of birds will nest in homes built for them
if these houses are of the right shape and dimensions. Other
birds may be just as desirable but do not build nests and rear
their young in boy-made nesting boxes. We are therefore mainly
concerned with the first group which select cavities in trees
for their homes if nothing better is to be found.</p>
","webmaster@example.org",2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build",,1,"bird-houses/birds"
"Bluebird","<p>This bird may be found during the summer months in most
of the states east of the Rocky Mountains, Figs.1 and 59. It
spends its winter in the southern states and southward, returning
north in March and April. The principal items of food are
grasshoppers, caterpillars and beetles. It should have a house
measuring about 5"" in length and width, inside measurements,
and 8"" or more in depth. The entrance hole should be 1-1/2"" in
diameter and placed near the top, so that the young birds cannot
get out until strong enough to have some chance of escape
from their enemies after they leave the nest. While authorities
differ as to the need of cleaning after a season's use, it seems
wise to provide the house with some device whereby the bottom
may be removed for such purposes. Houses for this species are
shown in Figs. 11, 21, 22, 24.</p>

"Robin","<p>Robins usually announce the coming of spring when they
return to their breeding grounds in the northern states, where
they are general favorites. Figs. 2 and 60. The nest is usually
built of mud and lined with grasses; placed in the fork of a tree
or on some sheltered ledge. Robins take kindly to nesting shelves
put up for them and it is well to put up several since but
one brood is reared in each nest built. This old nest should be
removed after the young birds have gone. A simple shelf is
shown in the lower left hand corner of the photograph, Fig. 24,
as well as in Figs. 20 and 49.</p>

"Chickadee","<p>The chickadee is one of the brave little spirits who spends
the entire winter with us, Fig. 3. We can be of considerable
service to him during the cold weather by providing food shelters.
During the summer months his home is usually found in
some decaying stump, hence nesting boxes of the rustic type
placed in some remote spot of the orchard or park are most
attractive to him.</p>
","webmaster",2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build","Birds that live in nesting boxes",2,"bird-houses/birds/chickadee"
"Wren","<p>When all other song birds fail to take advantage of a house
built for them, the wren may still be counted on. Almost any
sort of home from a tin can or hollow gourd on up is satisfactory
if put in a safe place and provided with an opening 1"" or
slightly less in diameter, so the sparrows must stay out, Figs. 4
and 5. Good homes are shown in Figs. 10, 14, 15, 16 and others.</p>
","webmaster@example.org",2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build","Birds that live in nesting boxes",3,"bird-houses/birds/wren"
"House finch","<p>The house finch has made many enemies because of its fondness
for cultivated fruits and berries. However, it has some
redeeming features in its song and beauty. The nest is usually
placed in the fork of a limb&mdash;evergreens being favorite nesting
places. The house shown in Fig. 51 is suitable for these birds
but is also acceptable to wrens.</p>
",,2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build","Birds that live in nesting boxes",4,"bird-houses/birds/house-finch"
"Woodpecker","<p>The favorite of this interesting family is the little downy,
Fig. <a href=""#fig_7"">7</a>. Living largely upon harmful grubs and insects, this bird
does an immense amount of good by protecting our forests from
insect scourges. Woodpeckers do not build nests as most birds
do, but excavate a deep cavity in some dead tree leaving a quantity
of chips at the bottom on which the eggs are laid. Nesting
boxes should be of the rustic type made as shown in Fig. 12,
leaving some sawdust mixed with a little earth in the cavity.
These houses should be placed on trees in a park or orchard.
Boys should be able to tell the difference between the woodpeckers
beneficial to man and the sapsucker whose misdeeds often
cause considerable damage to fruit trees. A nuthatch is also
seen in Fig. 7 enjoying a meal of sunflower seed.</p>
",1,2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build","Birds that live in nesting boxes",5,"bird-houses/birds/woodpecker"
"Flicker","<p>The flickers spend much of their time on the ground in
search of ants which form the larger percentage of their food.
Since ants sometimes cause considerable trouble for other birds,
a pair of flickers are worth cultivating for the sake of the work
they can do. Artificial nesting boxes of sufficient depth and size
are quite readily used, Figs. 6, 20 and 25.</p>","webmaster",2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build","Birds that live in nesting boxes",6,"bird-houses/birds/flicker"
"Martin","<p>Nearly everyone knows swallows of one variety or another.
The most beautiful of the family are the martins, Fig. 8. This
bird is of great service against the inroads of wasps, bugs and
beetles. It prefers to live in colonies even though the males fight
bitterly at times. Martin houses should have at least several
rooms, each separate from all the others. Houses have been built
to accommodate fifty and more families. Smaller ones are shown
in Figs. 8, 9, 13 and 45.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 is a miniature reproduction of Peer Gynt's cottage for a martin
house. This house was not only an attractive thing to make, but martins
selected it for their home during the past summer.</p>
","webmaster@example.org",2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build","Birds that live in nesting boxes",7,"bird-houses/birds/martin"
"Construction of bird houses","<p>Bird houses may be divided into three main classes: (1)
those made of sawed lumber to specified dimensions; (2) the rustic
type made of (a) slabs of wood with the bark left on, or (b)
pieces of tree trunk, or (c) of sawed lumber trimmed with bark
or twigs; and (3) cement or stucco houses. In each case the
entrance should slant slightly upward to keep the rain out.</p>

<p>Almost any sort of lumber may be used, but birds take most
readily to that which has been weathered out of doors. A kind
should be used which does not warp or check badly; white pine
and cypress meet these requirements and are worked with ease.
Yellow poplar is used and cedar with or without the bark left
on has its friends for houses of the first or second classes.</p>

<p>Nesting boxes of sawed lumber should be painted on the
outside to improve their appearance and to preserve them against
the effect of the weather. It is often wise to leave a small amount
of unpainted surface around the entrance, and all paint should be
thoroughly dry before houses are expected to be occupied. Colors
selected will depend somewhat upon the neighborhood, but white,
grey, dull greens or browns are often used.</p>",,2008-12-23,"Bird Houses Boys Can Build",,2,"bird-houses/construction"
"Dimensions of nesting boxes","<p>The following table, copied from Farmers Bulletin, No. 609,
U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, gives in small space valuable information
about dimensions that experience and investigation have
indicated as good for particular varieties of birds. This list includes
many varieties that do not commonly live in houses built
for them, however. As time goes on, we may expect to find more
of these birds living in our nesting boxes because they are apt
to seek the same sort of home as the one in which they were
reared. The table is given to be of service to those wishing to
plan new houses not shown here.</p>

"Houses of sawed lumber","<p>The boy with an outfit of tools at home, or with a teacher
of manual training interested in birds, can make all of the houses
to be described in this section. Figs. 10 and 11 show simple
houses for wrens and bluebirds. Drawings for this type of house
are shown in Figs. 14, 15 and 21. While the surfaces of lumber
used for these houses may or may not be planed, care must be
taken that all pieces are sawed or planed to the correct sizes with
edges and ends square and true so there will be no bad cracks for
drafts and rain to enter. Be careful to nail the pieces together
so that they will not have occasion to crack or warp. A good way
to save time and lumber is to prepare a piece of stock, getting it
of the right thickness, width and length, and then to saw up
this stock on lines carefully laid out as shown in the drawings
of the bluebird and wren houses, flicker nest, robin shelf and
finch house. The most difficult houses to build are those for
martins. In Fig. 45 is given a drawing for a small home arranged
to care for eight families, while the photographs, Figs. 8,
9, 38, 66 and 67 show larger, finer and more difficult houses. The

doors or openings are 2-1/2"" in diameter and can be made with
an expansion bit or a key-hole saw. All of these houses are to
be made so they may be cleaned. Sometimes the bottom is hinged
on two screws or nails, and held in proper place by a dowel
(bluebird house, Fig. 21); or screwed in place (wren house, Fig.
21, and martin house, Fig. 45); or hinged and held in place by
a brass spring (wren house, Fig. 14).</p>

"Cement and stucco houses","<p>Houses may be cast of concrete
as Fig. 39. This requires
a mold or form, and takes considerable
planning to insure success.
A form is made whose inside
dimensions are those of the
outside of the bird house, and of
the desired shape. A second
form, or core, to be placed inside
of the first form, is made as large
as the inside of the bird house.
The two forms must be mounted
so they will remain in the
right relation while concrete is
placed in the space between
them. After this has set, the forms may be removed, cleaned and
used again. The roof is generally made separately and put in
position last. Or the roof can be cast as a part of the house in
which case the bottom is inserted last. Birds do not take as
kindly to this type of house as a rule, as to those made of wood.</p>

<p>The stucco house has many possibilities. Fig. 38, shows a
group of such houses designed to match the general appearance
of garages in good residence districts. The frame is made
of wood and t Pg020 co applied by one of the methods in use on
large houses. Seventh grade boys have made such houses, using
3/8"" material for the frames, tacking on wire netting and then
plastering each side of the house in turn with concrete. The
sides were given a pebble-dash surface, while the roof was finished
with a steel trowel to give a smooth surface that will shed
water readily, Fig. 13.</p>
