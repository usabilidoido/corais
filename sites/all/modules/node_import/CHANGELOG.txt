Changes since DRUPAL-6--1-0-RC1:
 * by robrechtj : error in types list of user.inc
 * by robrechtj : display an clear error when the user does not have
   the necessary permissions and show the buttons (eg Reload) so the
   user still sees it is a form.
 * by robrechtj : better sorting of the content types.
 * #344663 by robrechtj : add sample data on mapping page as well.
 * by robrechtj : get rid of hook_node_import_static() and call it

   beautiful with an _alter().

   values" page to be displayed. Thanks biohabit!
