AutoUpload is a user interface (UI) enhancement for uploading files.

Currently, users must select files, then press the "Upload" button. We
found users often don't realize a button press is necessary and mistakenly
think their image is uploaded when it's not.

This module removes the extra button press and hides the "Upload" button
via JavaScript for a quicker file upload UI. When JavaScript is not
enabled, it falls back to the "Upload" button.
