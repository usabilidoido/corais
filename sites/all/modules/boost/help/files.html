<p>The cached files are stored (by default) in the cache/normal/ directory under your Drupal installation directory. The Drupal pages' URL paths are translated into file system names in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<p>http://example.com/<br />
=> cache/normal/example.com/_.html</p>
<p>http://example.com/about<br />
=> cache/normal/example.com/about_.html</p>
<p>http://example.com/about/staff<br />
=> cache/normal/example.com/about/staff_.html</p>
<p>http://example.com/node/42<br />
=> cache/normal/example.com/node/42_.html</p>
</ul>
<p>You'll note that the directory path includes the Drupal site name, enabling support for multi-site Drupal installations.</p>
