<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>This module provides static page caching for Drupal 6.x websites. It provides a significant performance increase as well as scalability for sites that receive mostly anonymous traffic. Web pages load very fast from the cache instead of waiting on PHP and Drupal to serve them from the database. If the page is not found in the cache, then the request is passed to Drupal. The built-in crawler makes sure expired content is quickly regenerated to insure fast page loading at all times.<br />
&bull; The guy that is writing this could brag about Boost, but he will let you do that part. Enjoy !</p>
