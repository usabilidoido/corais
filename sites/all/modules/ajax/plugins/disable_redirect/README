Ajax Forms disable redirect module

This will disable a redirection for a form after a successful form submission.
Please note that this plugin may not work as expected with all forms.
For instance, some forms may require a new form token to be set between form
submissions. This could prevent the same form from being submitted twice.
Another consideration is that not all forms will send a status message
back to the client after a successful submission.
