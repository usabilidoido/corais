These patches were built for Captcha 6.x-1.0-rc2. They are not guaranteed to
work on other versions. Use at your own risk.

As of now, Captcha 6.x-2.0-beta4 is not currently supported, due to its rather
unstable nature. When a final, stable Captcha 2 is released, this module will
be updated to support it.

These patches must be applied from the root of the captcha module directory.
For help on applying patches, see http://drupal.org/node/60108.
