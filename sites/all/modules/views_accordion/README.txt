/* DESCRIPTION */

Views Accordion provides a display style plugin for the Views module.
It will take the results and display them as a JQuery accordion. It supports grouping of fields and ajax pagination.


/* INSTALATION */

1. Place the views_accordion module in your modules directory (usually under /sites/all/modules/).
2. Go to /admin/build/modules, and activate the module (you will find it under the Views section).


/* USING VIEWS ACCORDION MODULE */

Your view must meet the following requirements:
  * Row style must be set to Fields
  * The header field can not be set to inline.
  * If you use a separator for inline fields, be sure to wrap it in a html tag, for example: <span>|<span>.
  * Provide at least two fields to show.

Choose Views Accordion in the Style dialog within your view, which will prompt you to configure:
  * Transition time: How fast you want the opening and closing of the sections to last for, in seconds.
    Default is half a second.
  * Start with the first row opened: Whether or not the first row of the view should start opened when the view is first shown.
    Uncheck this if you would like the accordion to start closed.
  * Use the module's default styling: If you disable this, the CSS file in the module's directory (views-accordion.css) will not be loaded.
    You can uncheck this if you plan on doing your own CSS styling.  

*        IMPORTANT       * 
The first field WILL be used as the header for each accordion section, all others will be displayed
when the header is clicked. The module creates an accordion section per row of results from the view.
If the first field includes a link, this link will not function, (the js returns false) Nothing will break though.
