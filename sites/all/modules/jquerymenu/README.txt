Jquery menu

*************************
Jquery menu uses simple, cross browser compatible jquery to transform your multilevel menus into click and expand menus. Yes this module is similar to dhtml menus and active menus, but it is different in a couple of key ways. 
1.	Unlike dhtml menus (which requires you to click twice on a link to actually follow an expanded link) Jquery menus separates the link from the expanding mechanism (there is a small plus symbol that you click instead to expand the menu). This makes for a more natural navigation.
2.	Unlike active menus, which makes ajax calls to fill in the lower level menus when you click the plus symbol, Jquery menu creates the menu in full on the initial page load.  I personally have used active menus for several months and have found that those ajax calls are not as stable as simple jquery. 
3.	Unlike Active menus which transforms all menus into active menus once the module is turned on, Jquery menu only creates a jquery block for the menus that you specify. To chose which menus you want to be active you just have to visit the admin page at 'admin/settings/jquerymenu' .
4.	Jquery menu is easily themable. Since the jquery menu blocks only use a small number of styles and don’t use the default list styles overriding it with your own css is easy.  Also the important display elements are contained in themable functions so you can tinker with it.

I may backport this to 5x at some point.
