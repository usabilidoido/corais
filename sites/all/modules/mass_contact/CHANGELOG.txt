    be selected by default, and the mail page will respect those choices.
    Added the two feature requests listed here: http://drupal.org/node/170837,
    namely, hiding the categories checkbox, if there is only one category, and
    it is set as selected, and showing descriptive text instead of the BCC
    checkbox, if users are not allowed to change the setting.
    Rearranged the admin settings and the mail page, so that they flowed more
    like a standard e-mail sending form.

    Added more commenting to the code. There's still more to do.
    Probably some other stuff I forgot about.  :^)  (This was supposed to be a
    quick change to a couple of things that ended up being a much bigger
    update that took a lot longer.)
