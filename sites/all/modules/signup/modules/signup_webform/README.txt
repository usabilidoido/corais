The signup webform module provides a signup pane for each webform node. This allows  users to quickly create a form to collect data specific to a signup event.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1. Create a signup-enabled node as normal.
2. Create a webform node.
3. Add some components to the webform.
4. Go to the signup node's settings. The webform you created appears as one of the possible signup panes. Enable this pane and drag it into the order you wish it to appear.
5. The webform components you added in step 3 now appear on the signup node. When users sign up to this node, webform submissions are created automatically. Webform submission data appears both in the webform submissions listing and in the signup listing.
6. You can repeat steps 2-6 to add more webforms to the same signup node; in general you can have several webforms per signup, and use one webform several signup nodes.
