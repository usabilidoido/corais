Upgrading Pageroute from 5.x.x to a 6.x version
------------------------------------------------

Many things have changed in Pageroute 6.x.
Most do only concern developers, who should look at the API at the drupal Handbooks for a 
documentation of the new API, but some things have also changed for users.

This document is about the changes, which are important and visible for users:

 * You can upgrade pageroute like any other module, remove the old files,
   add all new files and run your drupal's update.php.
   
 * There is no conversion for your existing pageroutes yet, if you need that stay
   tuned and wait for 1.0.

 * Pageroute arguments changed!
   In 5.x the first pageroute argument was always interpreted as a node id and
   the second argument as a user id.
   The argument order for 6.x has been changed, so the first one is the user id and the
   second one the node id.
   So to go through the route as another user e.g. as user with the id 5, but without
   passing a node id just us the URL:
                                pageroute_url/5/0

 * The Node Managment page is not longer supported. It was to complicated and we had no
 	 need for it. You'll have to remove pages from pageroutes that uses this page types.

 * Submit like tabs buttons are also deprecated. They were to buggy and complicated to fix 
 	 them and we don't need them anymore.  
 	 
 * API docs for 6.x are not yet finished, but can be expected before the 1.0.
