<p>The quiz module allows users to administer a quiz, as a sequence of questions, and track the answers given. It allows for the creation of questions (and their answers), and organizes these questions into a quiz. Its target audience includes educational institutions, online training programs, employers, and people who just want to add a fun activity for their visitors to their Drupal site.</p>

<p>The quiz module has a plethora of permission options. Unless you take care setting your permissions, the quiz module might not do everything you want it to do.</p>
