To install this module, navigate to admin/build/modules and enable the module. The 'colorpicker' module does nothing by itself but provide a new form element called a 'colorpicker_textfield'.

See the colorpicker_example.module for example of its use.

The Colorpicker CCK module makes the colorpicker_textfield form element available for use in CCK forms.
