<h3>Embedding Views</h3>
<p>Embed a date browser or calendar view anywhere using the format: <pre>date_embed_view($view_name, $display_name, $settings, $args)</pre> 
Settings are used to override some values of the view.</p>
<p>The primary setting that is useful here is a setting for 'block_identifier'. The view's block_identifier is used to control individual instances of regular and embedded views that contain date navigation so that they move separately or together. All views that use the same identifier will move together. 
All views that use different identifiers will move independently. The identifier will show up in the url as a querystring, like node/275?mini=calendar/2008-10. 
Page views use no block identifier, the normal identifier of the block view is 'mini'.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;?php print date_embed_view('calendar', 'calendar_1'); ?&gt;</dt>
<dd>This will embed the default page view of the calendar, using the regular calendar defaults.</dd>
<dt>&lt;?php print date_embed_view('calendar', 'calendar_1', array('block_identifer' => 'embedded'), array('2008-W45')); ?&gt;</dt>
<dd>This will embed the page view of the calendar that will use 'embedded' as an identifier, set to show the week view for week 45 of 2008.</dd>
<dt>&lt;?php print date_embed_view('calendar', 'calendar_block_1', array('block_identifier' => 'mini'), array('2008-07')); ?&gt;</dt>
<dd>This will embed the block view of the calendar that will use 'mini' as an identifier, set to show the month view for July 2008.</dd>
</dl>
