Nodereference Views Select
==========================

Provides a widget for Node Reference which displays only the currently selected items as checkboxes or radio buttons in the node form. 
Candidate nodes are displayed in a modal panel which allows adding items to the selected items list. The checkboxes list is sortable
using jQuery UI sortables. This module is generally intended to use along with a View as the 'allowed values' source for the CCK field
but may also be used with a content-type-based list.

TODO:
Add exposed filters support to the modal panel in order to narrow the candidate list
