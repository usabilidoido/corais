DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
Improves the invitation process into organic groups. Actually, the improvement is at the user level, so the user that gets invited into an organic group will be able to join the group with a single click from the mail. The default invitation process in organic groups has some issues especially if the group is private or if the user is not already logged in when he accesses the join link. A more detailed description can be found on the project page: http://drupal.org/project/og_invite_link

INSTALLATION
---------------
- Copy the module into your modules directory and then just enable the module from backend. More details can be found here: http://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-5-6

NOTES
----------------
- The module replaces at the moment the original invitation process of organic groups.
