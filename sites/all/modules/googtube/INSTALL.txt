Readme
------

This is a simple filter module. It automatically converts URLs of 
Youtube and Google Videos into embedded.


Installation
------------

1. Copy the googtube.module folder to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Go to 'administer > modules', and enable the googtube.module

3. Go to 'administer > configuration > input formats' and enable the filter in
   the desired input formats.

4. Rearrange the filters on the input format's 'rearrange' tab to
   resolve conflicts with other filters.  After the HTML filter and before the URL Filter is probably best.
