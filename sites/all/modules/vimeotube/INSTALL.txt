Readme
------

This is a simple filter module. It automatically converts URLs of 
Vimeo Videos into embedded object code.


Installation
------------

1. Copy the vimeotube.module folder to the your Drupal contrib modules/ directory. (e.g.  sites/all/modules/, sites/default/modules/, or sites/SITENAME/modules/)

2. Go to 'administer > modules', and enable the vimeotube.module

3. Go to 'administer > configuration > input formats' and enable the filter in
   the desired input formats.

4. Rearrange the filters on the input format's 'rearrange' tab to
   resolve conflicts with other filters.  After the HTML filter and before the URL Filter is probably best.
