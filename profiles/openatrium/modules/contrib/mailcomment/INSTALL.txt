Installation instructions
=========================

#  Enable and configure messaging, notifications, and mailhandler modules.
  - http://drupal.org/project/messaging
  - http://drupal.org/project/notifications
  - http://drupal.org/project/mailhandler
#  Setup a mailbox for mailhandler which you'll use with mailcomment.
#  Enable the mailcomment module
#  Go to admin/messaging/mailcomment and configure as desired.  You must select at least one content type in order
   for mailcomment to work at all.
#  If a user does not have 'post comments' privilege, they will not be able to use mailcomment.  The notifications
that get sent to users without 'post comments' privilege will not contain the necessary information from mailcomment
in order for the user to reply via email.

That's it.  Now, when notifications are sent out, they should appear with the delimiter text.
The default delimiter text says "((( Reply ABOVE this LINE to POST a COMMENT )))".

# Note about mailcomment_extras module:  This module uses a few regular expressions targeted at specific email clients.
  mailcomment_extras can simply be enabled, and it will start trying to detect on incoming messages for mailcomment.  If a
  match is found, the default cleaner in mailcomment module itself will not be run, even if it is enabled to run.  If no 
  match is found, the default cleaner (if enabled on the settings page) will attempt to run and clean the message.


For developers
==============

# If you need to modify or maintain node parameters upon each reply, there is a hook_mailcomment_alter that allows plugin
modules to act on the node object of each message that comes in via mailcomment.


Known issues
============

#  If you get blank or incomplete messages, try turning off the "Message cleaner" on the mailcomment settings page.  There is a regex
that works most of the time, but may not work all the time.  This can lead to incomplete or lost messages.  If you turn the message
cleaner off, all comments that are posted via mailcomment will contain an email client byline at the bottom, like:

Upgrading
=========

From 6.x Beta 4 to 6.x Beta 5
-----------------------------

There are no required steps for upgrading from Beta4 to Beta5, but there are configuration changes you may want to
make on the Mail Comment settings page (admin/messaging/mailcomment).  Three new settings have been added:

* "Mail Comment-enabled mailboxes" - This setting makes it possible for incoming messages to mailcomment to come from
these different email addresses.  This setting cannot be taken advantage of with Mail Comment alone.  Add-on modules 
may require this setting.  For example, if an add-on module sets a different reply-to header, you can be sure replies
to that email box will get through to Mail Comment by choosing the mailbox(es) in this option.

* "Mail Comment catchall mailboxes" - If your mailbox is a catchall mailbox, you should choose it in this option. This
will make sure Mail Comment considers all messages going to an address based on the base domain of the mailbox.

* "Use mailing list-style subjects" - In order to support better message threading some email clients/providers require
consistency in the message subject instead of relying on the in-reply-to header.  If you check this option the subject
of outgoing messages on Mail Comment-enabled content types will be altered to read like: "[Site Name] Title of message"
instead of using the messaging template configured by the messaging module.


FAQ / Common issues
===================

* Quoted text does not get removed in replies.  If you experience this problem there are a few solutions you can try.
  
  - If your mailhandler mailbox is using "HTML" as its "MIME Preference" you can try switching to "Plain text" if you do 
  not need to support full HTML.
  
  - If you are using the "Mail Commet Extras" module, try disabling it and just use the default message cleaner.
  
  - On the Mail Comment settings page, try using a shorter string for the "Reply text".
  
  - Write your own message cleaning plugin module.  The default and extra cleaners provided by Mail Comment and Mail
  Comment Extras modules may not work with certain clients.  These cleaners use a few general tactics to try to clean
  the quoted text which may not cover the way various mail clients behave.




Roadmap
=======

# DONE - Add setting to control on what content types mailcomment should be allowed on.  Currently, any notification for a content type will go out with a mailcomment header/message.
# Any kind of handling for inline replies?
# DONE Ability to initiate a new post while using mailcomment (security issues must be sorted out)
# DONE Ability to use mailcomment with multiple email addresses, such as 1 address per OG.
# Improved error handling, error messages, and detailed instructions in mail footers
# Set a max-length on the demarcation line allowed, because a very long demarcation line ("PLEASE reply ABOVE...") will break a line and this may not get deteced (need to test).
# Allow for plugin to handle per-node or per-X on/off switch for mailcomment.  Right now, we just handle per-content type.
