DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
Enable users to create and manage their own 'groups'. Each group can have
members, and maintains a group home page where members can post into. Posts may
be placed into multiple groups (i.e. cross-posting) and individual posts may be
shared with non-members or not. Membership to groups may be open, closed,
moderated, or invitation only. Add-on modules are available for group image
galleries, group calendars, group vocabulary, group stores, and so on.

Groups may choose their own theme and language. Groups have RSS feeds and email
notifications and so on. Group admins may customize the layout and contents of
their group home page and add additional custom pages (requires the upcoming OG
Panels module).

INSTALLATION
---------------
- Enable the Organic groups and Organic groups Views integration modules. If you
  want to protect some posts so that only certain users may view them, enable
  the 'Organic Groups access control' module as well. Please make sure OG is
  working well on its own before enabling other OG related modules.
- On the Administer > Organic groups configuration page, see the content types
  table at the top. Click edit beside each type to set its 'usage'. Disable
  comments and attachments for node types which are designated as group nodes.
  You usually want to create a new node type via admin/content/types page and
  then designate that content type as a group node. See the first item in NOTES
  below. 
- Set other preferences on admin/og/og as desired. It may take some
  experimenting before you arrive at a configuration well suited to your needs.
- On the Administer â€º Site building > Blocks page, enable the 'Group details'
  and drag it toward the top of your list. Optionally enable the other 'Group'
  blocks.
- Grant permissions as needed on the admin/user/permission page 
- Begin creating groups (visit the node/add page), joining those groups, and
  posting into those groups. The join link appears in the Group details block,
  for non invite-only groups.
- Consider enabling the following modules which work well with OG: Pathauto,
  Locale, Notifications. After your install is working nicely, consider enabling
  more og add-on modules like og_mandatory_group, og_vocab, and og_panels. Those
  are known to work well with OG. Some of the others on drupal.org are poorly
  integrated and will cause problems.
  See http://drupal.org/project/Modules/category/90.

NOTES
----------------
- This module supports designating any content type to act as a group. This
  content type should be defined by a custom module or via the
  admin/content/types page. When defining your type, you usually want the title
  label to be 'Group name' and the body label to be 'Welcome message'. Since all
  nodes of this type are treated as groups, you will usually not want to
  designate the standard page, story, or book node types as groups. The feature
  where custom content types may act as groups enables you to have custom fields
  for your groups and even different CCK fields for different kinds of groups
  (i.e. content types). 
- There are a few handy tabs at the path 'group'. You might want to add a link
  in your Navigation to that url. Each tab also provides a useful RSS feed.
- 'Administer nodes' permission is required for changing the Manager of a group
  (do so by changing the posts' Author.)
- 'Administer nodes' permission enables viewing of all nodes regardless of
  private/public status.
- All membership management happens on the 'membership list' page which is
  linked from the group details Block (while viewing a group page). This
  includes approving membership requests (for selective groups), adding/removing
  users and promoting users into group admins.
- If you decide to stop using Organic groups, just disable it as usual. If you
  ever decide to re-enable, all your prior group access control information will
  be restored. If you want to start fresh, uninstall og, og_views and og_access
  modules.

DEVELOPERS & SITE BUILDERS
------------------
- You may craft your own URLs which produce useful behavior. For example,
  user/register?gids[]=4 will add a checked checkbox for to the user's
  registration page for subscribing to group nid=4. This feature overrides the
  usual preference for groups to always appear during registration.
- You may alter the links in the group details block using
  hook_og_links_alter($links, $group_node). See og_block_details().
- The current group context is available to javascript code at
  Drupal.settings.og. This is useful for enriching ad tags and analytics calls
  with group information.
- Use Views Bulk Operations module to mass update user memberships and also
  content affiliations.

THEMES
------------------
You may wish to stylize nodes which have properties assigned by this module.
--- public vs. private posts are denoted by $node->og_public (og_access provides
    private posts)
--- provided in this package are two template files which are in use by default
    for both groups and group posts. These can be starting points for your
    customization of look and feel of your group. To customize, copy one or both
    to your theme directory and edit as desired. Your theme directory must also
    implement node.tpl.php for your overrides to be recognized. Or you might use
    the og_panels module to achieve custom group homepages (and other group
    pages) that group admins can design themselves.

INTEGRATION
---------------------
- I recommend enabling the cron features of Notifications/Messaging modules.
  When you do, group email notifications are sent during cron runs, instead of
  immediately after a post is submitted. This speeds up posting a lot, for big
  groups. The delay also helps authors fix typos in their posts before the mail
  is sent.
- This module exposes an API for retrieving and managing membership via direct
  PHP functions [og_save_subscription()] and via XMLRPC.

UNIT TESTING
----------------------
This module comes with a few unit tests. Please help update and build more of
them. See http://drupal.org/simpletest

TODO/BUGS/FEATURE REQUESTS
----------------
- See http://drupal.org/project/issues/og. Please search before filing issues in
  order to prevent duplicates.

UPGRADING FROM 5.0 TO 6.x
-----------------
- The upgrade auto-enables the new og_views module. This is needed to get the
  same functionality that was present in D5.
- There is no support for migrating custom Views. Please redo those in Views2.
  You might need to use a Relationship.
- Group members block (og/2) block is now served by Views:
  views/og_members_block-block_1
- Group search is now in its own block which must be enabled manually. It used
  to be integrated into the Group details block.

UPGRADING FROM 4.7 TO 5.x
-----------------
- You must update to 5.x before updating to 6.
